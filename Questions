Where do virtual functions, vtable reside? 
Inheritance: Is there a base portion specifically in the derived object?
When do we use privatevirtual?

in a derived class, if your base class has a virtual destructor, your own destructor is automatically virtual. You might need an 
explicitly defined destructor for other reasons, but there’s no need to redeclare a destructor simply to make sure it is virtual. 
No matter whether you declare it with the virtual keyword, declare it without the virtual keyword, or don’t declare it at all, it’s 
still virtual.
